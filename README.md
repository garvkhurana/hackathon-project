Phishing Website Detector
Welcome to the Phishing Website Detector project repository! This project was developed during a hackathon, where the frontend was created by my friends Hardik Mudgal and Kartik, while the backend and model were developed by myself and my friend Jayant Bisht. We used a Random Forest algorithm for the backend, achieving an impressive 96% accuracy rate.

Project Overview
Phishing Website Detector is a tool designed to identify potential phishing websites based on various features extracted from URLs. The features we used for detection are:

having_ip_address
url_length
shortining_service
having_at_symbol
double_slash_redirecting
prefix_suffix
having_sub_domain
sslfinal_state
domain_registration_length
favicon
port
https_token
request_url
url_of_anchor
links_in_tags
sfh
submitting_to_email
abnormal_url
redirect
on_mouseover
rightclick
popupwindow
iframe
age_of_domain
dnsrecord
web_traffic
page_rank
google_index
links_pointing_to_page
statistical_report
Usage
To use the Phishing Website Detector:

Clone or download this repository.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Navigate to the backend directory.
Install the required dependencies by running:
Copy code
Run the backend server by executing:
Copy code
python app.py
Once the server is running, you can access the frontend developed by Hardik Mudgal and Kartik, which communicates with the backend for phishing website detection.
